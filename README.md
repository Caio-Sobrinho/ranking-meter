# ranking-meter
The challenge was to create a variable to store the name and amount of experience (XP) of a hero, then use a decision structure to present messages according to their rank.

If XP is less than 1,000 = Iron
If XP is between 1,001 and 2,000 = Bronze
If XP is between 2,001 and 5,000 = Silver
If XP is between 5,001 and 7,000 = Gold
If XP is between 7,001 and 8,000 = Platinum
If XP is between 8,001 and 9,000 = Ascendant
If XP is between 9,001 and 10,000 = Immortal
If XP is greater than or equal to 10,001 = Radiant

Exit ->
At the end, a message should be displayed:
"The Hero named **{name}** is at **{level}**"

The following techniques were used:
- Variables
- Operators
- Repeat loops
- Decision structures

This material was used to complement my studies on programming logic.
